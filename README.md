Explain CLIP loss in detail

Break down the calculation of `loss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0)` with a detailed example.

### What is Cross-Entropy Loss?

Cross-entropy loss is a measure of the difference between two probability distributions: the true labels and the predicted probabilities. It is commonly used in classification tasks where the goal is to measure how well the predicted probabilities align with the actual labels.

### Formula for Cross-Entropy Loss

### Explanation of `loss_i = cross_entropy_loss(logits, labels, axis=0)`

- **`logits`:** This is a matrix of predicted scores (logits) for each pair of image and text embeddings. For a batch size \( n \), `logits` will be an \( n \times n \) matrix.
- **`labels`:** These are the true labels, an array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` indicating that the correct pairings are along the diagonal of the `logits` matrix.
- **`axis=0`:** This indicates that we are calculating the cross-entropy loss across rows. This means we treat each row in the `logits` matrix as a separate classification problem where the goal is to correctly identify the matching text for each image.

### Example

Let's consider a batch of 3 image-text pairs. The `logits` matrix might look like this:

```python
logits = np.array([
    [10, 2, 3],
    [2, 10, 4],
    [3, 5, 10]
])

labels = np.array([0, 1, 2])
```

Here, each row corresponds to an image, and each column corresponds to a text. The diagonal elements (10, 10, 10) are the correct matches.

### PyTorch Implementation

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example logits
logits = torch.tensor([
    [10.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    [2.0, 10.0, 4.0],
    [3.0, 5.0, 10.0]
], requires_grad=True)

# Corresponding labels
labels = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])

# Compute the cross-entropy loss for images (axis=0)
loss_i = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels)

# Print the loss
print("Cross-entropy loss for images (loss_i):", loss_i.item())
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Logits and Labels:**
   - `logits`: A tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`. Each row corresponds to an image, and each column corresponds to a class (text in this case).
   - `labels`: A tensor containing the true class indices. For a batch size of 3, it would be `[0, 1, 2]`, meaning that the 1st image corresponds to the 1st class, the 2nd image to the 2nd class, and so on.

2. **Cross-Entropy Loss Calculation:**
   - PyTorch's `F.cross_entropy` function combines `log_softmax` and `nll_loss` (negative log likelihood loss) in a single function for numerical stability.
   - It computes the softmax of the logits internally, applies the log, and then calculates the negative log likelihood loss using the provided labels.

### Detailed Calculation

#### Logits:

```python
logits = torch.tensor([
    [10.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    [2.0, 10.0, 4.0],
    [3.0, 5.0, 10.0]
], requires_grad=True)
```

#### Labels:

```python
labels = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2])
```

#### Step-by-Step for the First Row (Image 0):

In the provided example, `F.cross_entropy` handles these calculations internally, ensuring numerical stability and efficiency.

### Conclusion

By using `F.cross_entropy` in PyTorch, the logits are directly converted into probabilities using softmax, and then the cross-entropy loss is computed. This example demonstrates how to calculate the cross-entropy loss for a batch of image-text pairs, ensuring that the model learns to align images with their corresponding texts effectively.
